Virtual Paper Fortune Teller
Create a program that emulates the experience of a paper fortune teller (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_fortune_teller#Telling_fortunes). The program should:

Ask for a color chosen from 4 colors
Ask for a number chosen from a set of 4 numbers depending on which color was chosen
Repeat step 2 as long as youâ€™d like
Finally, have the user choose from a set of 4 numbers and reveal a fortune related to that number
